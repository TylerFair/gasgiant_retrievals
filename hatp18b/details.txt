Currently this only takes into account the R100 NIRISS data 

I'm taking some inspiration from Michael in this area:
Log scattering factor not actually U(0,1) but U(-2.,5.)-ish, and scattering slope (0,12)ish instead of 4 for a power-law haze. 

I'm taking inspiration from Rafael's K2-18 for some other parameterizations:
- Fit for plaent mass and fix stellar Teff (the big one is fixing teff)
- Fit for spots as Uniform from U(3000, Teff)
- Fit for spot frac as U(0,0.2) instead of U(0,0.5) 
- log cloudtop pressure U(0,8) Pa 

Other notes: 
- No longer fitting error multiple and depth offset for a single instrument.
